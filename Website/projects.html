                <span class="project-date"><i>2023</i></span>
                <p>Developed a web scraper for <a href="https://hedgefollow.com" target="_blank">hedgefollow.com</a>
                    using Python, leveraging BeautifulSoup, Selenium,
                    requests, regular expressions, and CSS selectors. The scraper extracted data from the past 24 hours
                    and stored it in JSON format for further analysis. This data was used to identify the greatest stock
                    changes and percentage shifts among insiders. Using the Twitter API and cron jobs, I automated
                    tweets to report the insiders with the largest portfolio movements in terms of magnitude and
                    percentage when compared to all other insiders for the given time period. I also handled various
                    edge cases as the project
                    progressed, such as for instance, modifying the cron job to prevent it from running on weekends and
                    ensuring smooth
                    functionality
                    throughout the project.</p>

                </br></br>
                Part I:
                </br></br>As it was my first time socket programming, there was a lot of learning to do such as learning
                what IP addresses, ports, and how data were handled at each node. It was great to see real world
                application of programming concepts I had learned in class bring to life a chatroom, via a ‘server’ and
                ‘clients’. I used Java’s interfaces, abstractions, and enums. I was able to easily create an interface
                with modularity in mind for scalability and rigidity to handle different types of encryptions and their
                respective operations where appropriate. A flaw introduced in this project was the key that was used to
                encrypt and decrypt messages among the clients in the network. This meant that with a packet sniffer it
                would be easy to simply intercept the key and use it to gain unauthorized access to the messages between
                clients in the network. This is exactly what will be investigated in Part II.
                </br></br>Part II:</br></br>An existing packet capture library called Jpcap was already available in
                Java. Therefore, I used this library in the chatroom I created in Part I by configuring it through a
                pom.xml file and Maven. I learned to look through the Jpcap documentation to find relevant functions to
                intercept messages sent through plain text in the network. After extending the program a bit more, the
                Initial Vector and Decryption Key could also be intercepted in the network as I knew the implementation
                of the chatroom system. Further filtering and conversions in the data stream had to be made to make the
                program run smoothly.</p>
